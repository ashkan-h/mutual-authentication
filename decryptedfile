1) To install the libraries: 
	The python program relies heavily on the Crypto module. Which can be simply downloaded by running below commands[1]:
	sudo apt-get install python-dev
	sudo pip install pycrypto


2) To generate the public and private key pair for both client and the server there you need to run the below scripts:
	python serverGenKey.py
	python clientGenKey.py
	The two scripts create two folders ssh style with the public and private key in them: ".server" and ".client"
	after running serverGen and clientGen, if we do "ls -la":
	we should see the hidden directories ".client" and ".server"

	Server and Client have two important functions each:
	In server we have:
	retrieveClientPublicKey and retrieveServerPrivateKey. The first one uses the public key of
	the client stored in ".client" (i.e., ./.client/client_rsa.pub). It is used to verify the 
	encrypted file. By using it as:

	clientPublick = retrieveClientPublickKey()
	clientPublicKey.verify(hashedData, signature)

	The retrieve server private key takes the file in ./.server/server_rsa and then its used to decrypt the encrypted key. 
	privKey = retrieveServerPrivateKey()
	decryptedKey = privKey.decrypt(encryptedKey)

	Similarly in client we use retrieveClientPrivateKey , retrieveServerPublicKey in the similar fashion to encrypt the
	shared password using the server's public key, and sign the encrypted file using client's private key.


3) Run the program as below:
	python server.py 4444 u
	OR
	python server.py 4444 t

	after running the server run the client in another session/terminal:
	
	python client.py 1234567891234567 /home/ashkan/Columbia/Network/sec.txt 127.0.0.1 4444

        In the above example, the first arguement is the password *1234567891234567* that we will share with the
	server for Key to our AES, the second is the file that we are encrypting. (I used README.txt for testing purposed)
	to the file that we want to sign and encrypt. The fourth and the fifth arguement
	is the ip address of the server and port number respectively.
